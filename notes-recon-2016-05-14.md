Neil Katin's notes from the 14 May LAH CERT exercise
====================================================

(Focussed on the Recon function)
--------------------------------

* Need a briefing checklist, to avoid leaving points out
        * (preprinted form with fill-in fields?)
    * checkin procedures
    * current frequencies
    * relaying teams who can't communicate
    * return / reporting procedures
    * "drill traffic"
    * distribute recon team 'book' with maps, etc
    * cell phone # to use for radio failure
    * ensure food/water

* Need a Field Team checklist, to remind folks what needs to be done
    * check in with Net Control:
        * leaving, arriving on station, returning, arrive at ark
    * need to clarify where to return forms to (and who will check for accuracy/completeness): checkin or recon
    * some teams went checkin to staging; recon never marked them as back (some of this was lack of process between netops and liason)
    * process for "all ok"
    * need to practice forms more
    * avoid giving addresses if we record status on original assignment form (or can at least refer to it)?
      This would have saved significant time.

* Current process makes it hard to re-task teams in the field
    * no backlog of assignments at recon
    * no maps with field teams

* Net control
    * need extra clip boards in case of wind
    * need better procedures for net control/scribe
        * should encourage county class
        * should extract simple 'best practices' for those who haven't taken the class
        * e.g. Net Control sends/fills forms, Scribe does logs and organizes backlog
    * samples of 'correctly filled' forms
    * backboard for station to clip forms/assignments to
    * net control couldn't send texts to field teams because 'too bright to read screen'

* need a way of tracking location of teams
    * I created a form with these fields 'on the fly':
        * team
        * time out
        * zone(s)
        * assignment ("survey overpass 5" or "fire at 123 main"
        * time back
    * currently recon has no copy of assignment forms unless we make a copy

* currently no function has a good idea of open/closed assignments - not ops, staging or recon
    * Multiple paper reports for each assignment
        * one or more from net control "in real time"
        * one from the team when they get back
        * problems get (multiple) Incident forms; process unclear how to report "all ok"
    * My suggestion: every field assignment get an ID so we can track open/closed and correlate reports.
        * I think this should be done at ops, but Carol thought staging would be better.

* useful extra supplies for recon station:
    * blue tape
    * binder clips
    * paper weights
    * stapler
    * white board markers + eraser
    * postit flags

* There was confusion about what to report back on the incident report
    * Larry had pre-printed forms with everything below #7 blocked off
    * Ops wanted more details.
    * Either way is fine; we just should decide in advance
    * Confusion about how to report "all OK" - Incident form, 213, or original assignment form?

* field team communication issues
    * 2 teams reported signicant areas of non-coverage, for both simples and W6LAH
        * no team recorded dead-zone on maps (we didn't ask): it should be part of our procedures
    * send recon email about N6NFI's signal strength test function

* Random Comments, non-recon
    * trash cans in ark, so plastic bags don't blow away
